## MusicShare

A social network for musicians where they can share song ideas in order to create music. Each user has a personal profile where they can upload audio files of songs they've been working on, images of album covers or just notes of lyrics. Each other user should be able to leave a comment after each musician's post on their wall so that feedback and ideas could be exchanged.

## MusicShare

###Description

A social network for musicians where they can share song ideas in order to create music. Each user has a personal profile where they can upload audio files of songs they've been working on, images of album covers or just notes of lyrics. They can also delete them as well. Each other user should be able to leave a comment after each musician's post on their wall so that feedback and ideas could be exchanged.

/* still not quite sure if each user will have a profile or just some users will connect at the same time, exchange ideas and then leave the space - to be continued */
